https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/visualizing-geospatial-data-in-python

**Course Description**

One of the most important tasks of a data scientist is to understand the relationships between their data's physical location and their geographical context. In this course you'll be learning to make attractive visualizations of geospatial data with the GeoPandas package. You will learn to spatially join datasets, linking data to context. Finally you will learn to overlay geospatial data to maps to add even more spatial cues to your work. You will use several datasets from the City of Nashville's open data portal to find out where the chickens are in Nashville, which neighborhood has the most public art, and more!
